  Two weeks in Panama City was quite enough, thank you! I've just arrived in Bocas del Toro after an
  overnight bus trip and am significantly happier with the situation here. Better weather, water
  nearby, friendly people, and having to get places by water taxi. I feel like I'm at Fisherman's
  Horizon (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLwtYlaqWaU">obligatory background music</a>).

        <p>
          The bus from Panama City to Bocas was taxing. You board a bus from Albrook mall at 8PM
          sharp and then arrive in Bocas 10 hours later, your back sore and the sun peeking over
          the horizon.
        </p>
        <p>
          I made the rather dull decision when I boarded to keep my backpack with me on the bus. In
          my defence, I assumed that I'd be able to put the bag between my legs. Well, now I've
          learned what it's like to have 30 pounds on your lap for 10 hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bus drops everyone off in Almirante. From here you're shuffled into a nearby taxi who,
          I swear, was trying to go back to the future. Without the necessary jig-a-watts however we
          merely arrived at the water taxis and paid our cabby $1 each.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inside the water taxi terminal you hand the lady your passport and $5 and she lets you on
          to the sardine boat that makes its way to the isle of Bocas.
