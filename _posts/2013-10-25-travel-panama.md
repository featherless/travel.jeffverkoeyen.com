title: "Traveling in Panama: Panama City"

  I want to learn Spanish before beginning a long-term trip around South America. In an effort to
  immerse myself, I've flown to Panama City as a staging ground. Panama's canal is the "crossroads
  of the world" so it seemed like a fitting place to begin my adventures (and to geek out over one
  of Earth's engineering marvels).
</p>
<p>
  It's my first time backpacking and I've already had a number of hard-earned lessons. I'm
  documenting them here for posterity though more experienced travellers will likely find some
  things redundant.

          The first time I tried to take cash ($200) out of an ATM I was surprised to have my
          transaction seemingly "canceled" right at the last second. Thinking this to be a fluke, I
          attempted another transaction with the same results. I had notified my bank of my travel
          plans so my card shouldn't have been getting blocked. After going to another bank and
          experiencing the same problem I decided to go back to my hostel and figure out what was
          going on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apparently I wasn't the first to experience this problem.
          <a href="https://getsatisfaction.com/axisbank/topics/atm_transaction_cancelled_but_money_is_deducted_from_axix_bank_account">Case #1</a>, 
          <a href="http://boquete.ning.com/forum/topics/atm-machine-problems?commentId=1434455%3AComment%3A427999&amp;xg_source=activity">Case #2</a>.
          Sure enough, when I checked my Bank of America account transactions I saw three successful
          withdrawals for $200 each; <strong>$600 had evaporated from my bank account</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I called BoA immediately to let them know what had happened and they told me I had to wait
          for the transactions to process. The next day I checked my account again and the three
          transactions had "cleared", along with three new $5 "fee" transactions issued by the ATMs.
          Thankfully after a quick call to BoA they said they'd file a claim and I'd have my money
          back within 48 hours.
        </p>
        <h2>How to actually get cash</h2>
        <p>
          After talking with BoA I decided to find a bank and try to speak with a teller directly.
          My ability to speak spanish was non-existent so I used the Google Translate app (which
          uses <a href="http://jeffverkoeyen.com/portfolio">Nimbus</a>, by the way!) to translate a
          bunch of key phrases and save them to my phone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inside the bank I was able to tell the teller that
          <em data-toggle="tooltip" title="My transaction was cancelled">mi transacci&oacute;n fue
          cancelada</em> and ask
          <em data-toggle="tooltip" title="Can I withdraw money?">&iquest;puedo retirar dinero?</em>,
          after which they took my passport, asked how much I wanted to take out, and then gave me
          the cash and a receipt.
