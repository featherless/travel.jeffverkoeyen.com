  Two weeks in Panama City was quite enough, thank you! I've just arrived in Bocas del Toro after an
  overnight bus trip and am significantly happier with the situation here. Better weather, water
  nearby, friendly people, and having to get places by water taxi. I feel like I'm at Fisherman's
  Horizon (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLwtYlaqWaU">obligatory background music</a>).

        <h1 style="text-align: center">ATVing</h1>
        <p>
          Beyond the city of Bocas on Isla Colon there is a massive expanse of jungle and sand
          beaches to explore, and explore we did. A buddy I met (Jim) and I rented a 4x4 from Flying
          Pirates for the day and shared it between us, making the cost $40.
        </p>
        <p>
          We picked up the 4x4 at about 10am and, after a quick training session at their warehouse,
          took off up the coast of Isla Colon. Riding the ATV was a blast. When maxed out it feels
          like you're flying along the road.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once we reached the jungle trail we had to slow down a bit because many of the trails
          had just recently been cleared. This part was a really fun challenge. With the ATV kicking
          and sliding we maneuvered through countless twists and turns through the jungle.

        <h1 style="text-align: center">Surfing</h1>
        <p>
          As part of our ATV trip up the coast we wanted to find some solid breaks to go surfing on
          because the swell had just arrived at Bocas. I've surfed a few times but in every sense
          am a beginner, so I was sorely unprepared for what was to come.
        </p>
        <p>
          After ATVing up the coast we picked a spot that was being surfed already and unloaded the
          boards. It looked like there were quite a few rocks and reefs to get over before reaching
          the open water, so we decided to walk down a ways. The reef didn't seem to let up, so Jim
          led the charge and we headed straight out to the water.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, Jim headed straight out to the water. I, not having much awareness, proceeded to
          step on a sea urchin. This shocked me enough to lift my foot out of the water just as a
          wave was rolling by my legs. I reached out my hands to stop my fall and found another sea
          urchin with the palm of my hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          As one final effort I jumped on my board to attempt to coast out to open water. Not used
          to such a small board, I jumped straight over it and proceeded to roll on the reef, making
          sure I had an even covering of urchins and reef cuts all over my body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Needless to say I didn't get much surfing done that day.

        <h1 style="text-align: center">Gran Kahuna Hostel</h1>
        <p>
          I've spent about one week at the Gran Kahuna hostel on Isla Caranero and love it for its
          tranquil escape from everything. It's a fairly big hostel with dorm beds, a bar, and food
          to order and the staff are wonderfully friendly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sand flies on Isla Carenero, however, make the stay here somewhat frustrating. These
          tiny little flies (nicknamed "noseeums") will land on your skin, puke on you, and then
          leave a rash that itches for days. After a few days my legs were covered in marks making
          it increasingly uncomfortable to sit out at the bar or anywhere near the sand.

        <h1 style="text-align: center">The Night Bus</h1>
        <p>
          The bus from Panama City to Bocas was taxing. You board a bus from Albrook mall at 8PM
          sharp and then arrive in Bocas 10 hours later, your back sore and the sun peeking over
          the horizon.
        </p>
        <p>
          I made the rather dull decision when I boarded to keep my backpack with me on the bus. In
          my defence, I assumed that I'd be able to put the bag between my legs. Well, now I've
          learned what it's like to have 30 pounds on your lap for 10 hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bus drops everyone off in Almirante. From here you're shuffled into a nearby taxi who,
          I swear, was trying to go back to the future. Without the necessary jig-a-watts however we
          merely arrived at the water taxis and paid our cabby $1 each.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inside the water taxi terminal you hand the lady your passport and $5 and she lets you on
          to the sardine boat that makes its way to the isle of Bocas.
