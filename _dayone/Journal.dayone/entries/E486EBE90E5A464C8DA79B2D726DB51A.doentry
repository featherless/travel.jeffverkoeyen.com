- Maria Luisa Santander 0329, Santiago 011291, Chile

&gt; How to get to the hostel from the airport or by subway (metro).
&gt; 
&gt; DO NOT PAY MORE THAN 18,000CLP FOR A TAXI from the airport!!
&gt; 
&gt; 1. When you leave the airport terminal, you will be surrounded by aggressive taxi drivers. Choose one and tell him the address and general area, Maria Luisa Santander 0329. In the neighborhood of Providencia by Parque Bustamante. Agree on a price, nothing more than 18,000 Chilean pesos. If they want to charge more, look for another driver.
&gt; 
&gt; 2. There is a simple airport bus. When you leave the terminal, escape the taxi drivers and look for a light blue bus with the word 'centropuerto' on the side. This bus departs every 15 minutes and will charge around 1,500 Chilean Pesos to take you to metro Los Heroes. From there you can take the metro to Baquedano which is a 15 minute walk or short taxi ride from the hostel (please refer to the map on walking directions from metro Baquedano).
&gt; 
&gt; If you want me to arrange a taxi, I will, but they charge a little more.
&gt; 
&gt; If you are arriving by car:
&gt; 
&gt; Take a deep breath; the streets in Santiago are a bit tricky. You have to go East on calle Providencia then turn right on Condell (you have to merge into the buses only lane to make this turn).
&gt; 
&gt; After several blocks you take another right on Calle Maria Luisa Santander (a one way street). We should appear on the left. 
&gt; 
&gt; We provide parking for 2.500 CLP per night, but spaces are limited. Please check ahead.
&gt; 
&gt; IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE YOUR ARRIVAL TIME ON YOUR BOOKING. IF ARRIVING BY PLANE, PLEASE EMAIL US WITH YOUR FLIGHT NUMBER AND MAKE SURE TO UPDATE US WITH ANY CHANGES. THANKS!!
