	<string>Ayacucho is a cute town built in a valley of the Peruvian mountains. It was our stopover for one night as we acclimatized to the elevation on our way to Cusco.

We didnâ€™t get to explore too much of the city, sadly, because we spent most of the afternoon here napping, though what we did see left us with a good impression. Particularly the night life in Ayacucho was active, with plenty of bars and clubs, and crowds of young Peruvians walking everywhere.</string>
