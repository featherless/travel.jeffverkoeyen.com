	<string>The Cali Zoo

After seeing that the zoo was the number one attraction in Cali we obviously had to make a point to visit it. A quick cab ride from our hostel brought us to the front gates of what turned out to be a very happening place.

Once we paid the (very reasonable) entrance fee, we walked in and started exploring. Overall we were actually delighted to see many animals we hadn't seen before: anteaters, many colorful parrots, iguanas all over the place, plenty of turtles, and pelicans hanging out with the flamingos. There was even a movie theater near the exit that was completely dedicated to leaf cutter ants, complete with synched lighting and scale models of ants in the walls.

We spent about two hours at the zoo overall and had a blast seeing kids getting excited by the monkeys and then getting excited ourselves (like kids).</string>
